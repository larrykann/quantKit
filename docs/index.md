# quantKit: High-Performance Quantitative Research Framework

## Overview

quantKit is a Python library designed for fast, accurate quantitative financial research and strategy development. Built with optimization in mind, it leverages NumPy's vectorized operations to achieve maximum performance while maintaining the flexibility of Python.

## Core Design Philosophy

- **Performance-Focused**: Optimized for speed using NumPy vectorization and efficient data structures
- **Data-Centric**: Built around a unified DataContainer that streamlines time series handling
- **Schema-Validated**: Enforces consistent data structures through standard schemas
- **Multi-Resolution**: Supports tick, intraday, and daily data analysis within the same framework
- **Stochastic Foundation**: Incorporates advanced statistical models for synthetic data generation and testing

## Key Components

### Data Management

The `quantKit.data` module provides a comprehensive suite of tools for handling financial time series:

- **DataContainer**: Core timestamp-indexed data structure for efficient storage and access
- **Standard Schemas**: Pre-defined field structures for common financial datasets
- **Adapters**: Connectors to various data sources with automated validation
- **Generators**: Stochastic model-based synthetic data creation

### Statistical Analysis

The `quantKit.stochastic` module enables rigorous statistical testing:

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create realistic market data based on statistical models
- **Permutation Testing**: Non-parametric hypothesis testing for strategy validation
- **Process Models**: Implementation of common stochastic processes (GBM, Poisson, etc.)

## Use Cases

- **Strategy Research**: Rapidly prototype and test trading strategies
- **Feature Engineering**: Develop and validate predictive features
- **Backtesting**: Evaluate strategy performance across various market conditions
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Prepare and validate data for ML model development
- **Synthetic Market Simulation**: Test strategies against generated scenarios

## Design for Growth

quantKit is structured to grow alongside your quantitative research needs, with clear separation of concerns and extensible components. The library focuses on building strong foundations that will support increasingly complex quantitative models and trading strategies.
